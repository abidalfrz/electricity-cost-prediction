# Electricity Cost Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting electricity costs based on various infrastructure and environmental features. The dataset originates from a Kaggle dataset and includes real-world attributes such as water consumption, recycling rate, air quality index, and more. The main goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates electricity cost per building.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

With the rising demand for energy efficiency in urban environments, predicting electricity consumption is critical for better resource management. This project aims to:

- Develop a regression model to predict `Electricity_cost`.
- Understand the impact of environmental and structural features on electricity cost.
- Evaluate and compare model performance using RMSE and R-Square.
