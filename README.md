# Electricity Cost Prediction

This repository contains a complete pipeline for a machine learning project aimed at predicting **electricity cost** using structured features such as building usage, population, environmental and utility metrics. The dataset comes from a Kaggle competition.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project tackles a regression problem, where the objective is to predict the **Electricity Cost** . The dataset includes multiple categorical and numerical attributes that reflect building structure, air quality, water usage, and more.

The data was sourced from a Kaggle dataset and includes `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and a `sample_submission.csv` file.
